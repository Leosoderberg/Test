        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Volvo Group, headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, is a leading company in the transportation and commercial vehicle industry. Volvo Group Digital & IT serves as an internal consultancy supporting all other departments. The research project focused on reviewing and mapping out the entire hiring system for new employees and consultants. The project's goal was to identify usability issues throughout the hiring process and define the responsibilities associated with each role.</p>

            <h2>Tackling the problem </h2>

            <p>I joined the project a few months after it had started pre-summer, with key interviews—our main source of information—already completed and transcribed. My task was to process and condense the findings into manageable information blocks and create timelines for each work role.</p>

            <div class="image-box">
              <img src="img/interviewvolvo.jpg" alt="picture showing the transcript from the different interviews" width="300" height="auto">
              <div class="info-box">
                <p><i>Interview materials</i></p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Using this information, we created service blueprints for each role. These blueprints described the process, objectives, thoughts, front-stage and backstage activities, actions, and pain points specific to each role. We cross-examined them to ensure their accuracy before proceeding to the next stage.</p>
           
            <div class="image-box">
              <img src="img/Service_Design_Blueprint.png" alt="picture showing a service blueprint that shows the problems and issues faced tidily" width="300" height="auto">
              <div class="info-box">
                <p><i>Service Blueprint</i></p>
              </div>
            </div>
           
            <p>Using these individual service blueprints we combined them into on overarching blueprint to easily showcase how all the different roles interacted with each other. This was done so that the combined blueprint could be hung up in the office and the easily be referred to when discussing needed changes to procedures and software.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <p>The project went well, we managed to get a much better idea of the hiring system, and the next part of the research process that I handed over to my collegues, will be to once again interview the leadership to get an even better idea of their workflow process.
